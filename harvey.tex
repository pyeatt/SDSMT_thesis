\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis is the first work ever done in 
the fascinating study of comparison of gnats to gnus.
It is groundbreaking.  There literally is nothing
like it.   However, there have been a few studies
of other things.

\chapter{Previous Work}


There has been a lot of previous work that is not at all like my work.
For example,
% The following if-then-else allows us to get good results with
% any bibliography/citation style.
\ifthesiscitations
\citeN{Kringle} % if we are using the thesiscitations style
\else
Kringle~\cite{Kringle} % if we are using a more primitive citation style
\fi
showed that apples and goats have almost
nothing in common, other than both being red.  The major problem with
Kringle's study is that he used a goat that had been spray painted
red, and his apple was a golden delicious variety.  Criticism of
Kringle's methods has been harsh, and so far, no one has been able to
replicate his results.

Several researchers have compared trout to
eagles~\cite{Simmons,Sheppard}.  The consensus that has emerged is
that they are quite different, and only an idiot would try to eat an
eagle~\cite{Idiot}.

\chapter{Methods}
In this chapter, I will present the methods for my comparison, and
fill in with a lot of gibberish.  For instance, I will say things like
``Gnats and Gnus come in twos'' in order to fill space and make my
thesis seem longer than it really is.  This is a tactic used by some
people to hide the fact that their research is worthless.  The idea is
that if the thesis is long enough and boring enough, the thesis
comittee members will go to sleep every time they try to read it.

Another thing that I may do is to use very long words, such as
onomatopoeia, for no apparent reason.  By employing voluminous
instances of obfuscatory and expansive vocables, the lack of
quintessence of this monograph can be adumbrated from all but
the most erudite, didactic, and scholarly bibliophiles.


\chapter{Results}
My research had fabulous results. I will now tell you about
the results, because they are the best!  You are not going
to believe how good my results are.

\section{Visual comparison}
%\index{comparison!visual}

\begin{table}
\caption{Results of visual comparison studies.}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \bf Categories & \bf Percent Correct\\
    \hline
    \hline
    insect/mammal & 76\\
    \hline
    gnat/gnu & 69\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{table:comp1}
\end{table}

The first test that I performed was a visual comparison of gnats and
gnus.  First, I went on the internet and downloaded several thousand
pictures of gnats, and one picture of a gnu.  Then, I had two
volunteers compare them and categorize them as insect
%\index{insect}
or mammal.
%\index{mammal}
Next, I selected another group of volunteers and
had them classify the photographs as either gnat or gnu.

\end{center}
\caption{Photographs of a gnu (left) and a gnat (right).}
\label{figure:photos}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The results of this comparison are shown in Table~\ref{table:comp1}.
As can be seen, both volunteers (myself and my advisor) were able to
correctly classify most of the photographs.  As a result, we gave each
other little gold stars.
For those who are interested, Figure~\ref{figure:photos} shows the gnu
photograph and one of the gnat photographs.

\section{Comparison by Size}
\index{comparison!size} As can be seen from
Figure~\ref{figure:photos}, photographs of gnats are slightly larger
than photographs of gnus.  This leads us to believe that
statistically, gnats are slightly larger than gnus.  Mathematically,
we express this as follows:
\begin{equation}
S(\mathcal{G}_t) > S(\mathcal{G}_u) \forall
\mathcal{G}_t,\mathcal{G}_u,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{G}_t$ is a photograph of a gnat and $\mathcal{G}_u$ is
a photograph of a gnu.  The $S()$ function calculates the ``size'' of
the photograph.

\chapter{Conclusions}

Well, there you have it.  My advisor and I were able to tell the
difference between a photograph of a gnat and a gnu most of the time.
Also, gnats are larger than gnus, and therefore, they are
significantly different.

In the future, we plan to apply the techniques developed in this
research to answer the age old question of whether dogs and ducks are
the same thing.
