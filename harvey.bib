                  common, other than both being red.  The major
                  problem with Kringle's study is that he used a goat
                  that had been spray painted red, and his apple was a
                  golden delicious variety.  Criticism of Kringle's
                  methods has been harsh, and so far, no one has been
                  able to replicate his results.}
